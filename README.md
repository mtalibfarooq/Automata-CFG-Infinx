# Automata-CFG-Infinx
A grammar can be used to describe the possible hierarchical structure of a program. Context-free grammars are more expressive than finite automata: if a language L is  accepted by finite automata then L can be generated by a context-free grammar. A context free grammar has 4 components: – A set of tokens, known as terminal  symbols. – A set of no terminals. – A set of productions where each production consists  of a no terminal, called the left side of the production, an arrow, and a sequence of tokens  and/or no terminals, called the right side of the production. – A designation of one of the  no terminals as the start symbol


 Rules is a python dictionary
 
• Spilt is used by regex library re
• Used indexing for list to split a num into different variables
• Open and closing are validated by data structure stack (push and 
pop)
• Conversion is also used in this program for associability of python
